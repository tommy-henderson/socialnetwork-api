# Social Network API

## Description

This is an API for a social network where users can create accounts, create thoughts, react to thoughts, and create a friend's list. 

## Installation

Download or clone the repository. Install the necessary packages. NodeJS and MongoDB are required. Type "npm start" into the command line to start the application and then you can open whichever API platform you want. I use Postman in my example. 

## Usage

In your API platform, you can test all the routes. GET routes are: Users, User by ID. Post routes are: add friend, create user, create reaction, and create thought. PUT routes are: update user, and update thought. DEL routes are: delete friend, delete user, delete thought, and delete reaction. See GIF below where I am testing some of the routes:
